# Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on using neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to model and understand complex patterns in data. It has driven breakthroughs in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and game playing.

## Key Concepts

- **Neural Networks**: Computational models inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected layers of neurons.
- **Layers**: Input, hidden, and output layers; deep networks have many hidden layers that enable hierarchical feature learning.
- **Training**: Adjusting network weights using large datasets and optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient descent) to minimize prediction error.
- **Activation Functions**: Non‑linear functions (ReLU, sigmoid, tanh) that allow networks to capture complex relationships.
- **Backpropagation**: Algorithm for efficiently computing gradients of the loss function with respect to each weight.
- **Regularization**: Techniques like dropout, weight decay, and batch normalization to prevent over‑fitting.

## Popular Architectures

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** – excel at image and video analysis.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) & LSTMs** – suited for sequential data such as text and time series.
- **Transformers** – state‑of‑the‑the‑art for natural language processing tasks.
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** – used for generating realistic images, videos, and more.

## Applications

- Image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
- Speech recognition and synthesis.
- Machine translation and text generation.
- Autonomous vehicles and robotics.
- Healthcare diagnostics and drug discovery.

## Getting Started

1. Choose a deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras).
2. Prepare a dataset and preprocess it.
3. Define a model architecture.
4. Train the model on your data.
5. Evaluate and fine‑tune the model.
